On 14/12/20, I decided to make a fan website for a ROBLOX group called 'unnattached', I didn't want much, I just wanted them to see it, or at least say thanks. I didn't even ask for robux or anything.


I spent 2 hours doing the planning, 3 hours doing the code and an additional 2 hours to make it responsive. (I know that's a long time but I'm a beginner, I was just trying my best). In the end, I was pretty proud of it, because I included a dark mode feature and some other cool stuff.

Once I had uploaded it to github, I went on her group and said:

<br> 'lol i spent 7 hours making a fan website !! i hope you enjoy.' -- I haven't got the screenshot  to prove this, but I have the screenshot to prove when the fan website was made. You can go check the times yourself for proof. <br>

She was online, but she didn't reply, so I went to sleep.

The next day, I woke up at 4am, and went to check on the group and see her reply.

I couldn't see the group on my groups bar, so I searched up the group only to find that:

1. My group wall posts were removed.
2. I was removed.

So, that's a funny story I wanted to share.

PS. Don't send hate to anyone involved.
